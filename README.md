web-statistics
The progect is written in java ee with tomcat server After unpack there should be visible a package "com.websearch", "index.html" and "web.xml" file.

After running program there is a form to put web page adress. Very important is to put full adress. After "submit" program sometimes does not work- by now I don't know why. But in most cases it works. It opens a web page that shows statistics of the given on form web page. Statistics show how many times each letter was used what is the average lenght of each word and what is most probable language of web page. By now it recognise English, German, French and Polish.
